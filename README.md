# RadianceCascades (WIP)
A 2D implementation of Radiance Cascades by Alexander Sannikov based on fad's implementation from Shadertoy. Working demo of Radiance Cascades, still requires merging of cascade0 to screen space.

Running the demo there are controls: _**up/down arrows**_ to change cascade mip-maps, _**left/right arrows**_ to change the cascade zero interval distance/
