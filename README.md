# RadianceCascades (WIP)
A 2D implementation of Radiance Cascades by Alexander Sannikov based on fad's implementation from Shadertoy. Working demo of Radiance Cascades, still requires merging of cascade zero to screen space--this is to generate the final screen sapce radiance field.

Running the demo there are controls: _**up/down arrows**_ to change cascade mip-maps, _**left/right arrows**_ to change the cascade zero interval distance.
